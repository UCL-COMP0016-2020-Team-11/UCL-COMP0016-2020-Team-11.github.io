# Week February 12th 2021
- We started with building the player.

## Why player?
- We have already built a editor, which allows the clinician to annotate the 360 video.
- But it is not convenient to use a editor to watch a video.
- So we need to build a player - with cleaner screen (less buttons).

## What we need for the player?
- Video Player: A video player that can play 360 videos.
- Hotspot Loader: A loader that can load hotspots from the json file and put them at the right place.
- Hotspot viewer: Allow users to read the information attached to the hotspot.

## First version 
- Only one play button on the screen.
- The hotspot view window only contains name, text, photo, video URL and a button to play the second video.
