# Week January 29th 2021
- We did several improvements on our prototype.
- We tried to add a progress bar to our video, but it introduces lots of bugs.

## Storing to Json
- Previously, we only stored the locations of our hotspots to the json file.
- Now we could add more information to the json file, including name, text, photo url and video url.
- Previously, a hotspot is formatted into a json format string and stored to a List when it is added.
- https://github.com/kellydingzx/360Editor-demo/blob/f5ed7ebb16a52262375721e45c99e5e16d5fc16f/Assets/Controller.cs#L53 
- Now we can store all the hotspots from the HashTable from the same time.

## Adding Progress bar
- We tried to add a progress bar to our video, but it introduced loads of bugs and even broke the whole player.
- So we have to revert to the previous version without the progress bar.
- We decided to use the progress bar from the group last year.
