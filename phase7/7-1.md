## Solving More bugs related

### Incorrect left-click on hotspot.
- Fix - the box collider was to larger for the object.

### Camera not facing the previous location after jumping back from the next video
```
videoManager.loadVideoAtFrame(prev_frame, url_video);
Camera.main.transform.LookAt(prev_hotspot);
controller.please_load();
```
- The video needs to be prepared and the camera needs to look at the hotspot.

## Refine the user interface
- We changed the arrangement of our user interface to be more understandable.
