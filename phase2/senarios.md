# Week October 31th 2020
After meeting with our clients, we came up Senarios and Personas about our project.

## Senarios
### Dietitian – The person who edit the video.
- My clinical background is as a Dietitian and I specialised in a field known as artificial feeding. This is where a patient receives nutrition via a feeding tube as they 
are unable to eat and drink due to an unsafe swallow. This can either be via a tube into their stomach (NG feeding is an example), or via a tube that delivers nutrients 
into their blood stream (this is known as TPN). I think medical students need to be more familiar with real working environment and knowledge from textbooks are not enough. 
- 360 videos may help, so students can watch the surgeries from all visions. The 360 video would be edited with hotspots to notes, pictures and other videos. And the file 
arrangement should be logical and organised. I would like to edit the video with a friendly editor, because I am not good at editing videos. Also, I would like to have all 
the hotspots at a precise location, since a small mistake will lead to a horrible disaster in medicine. I would like to circle the part or point out a point on the screen 
and add a hotspot to it which provides several options for the students. All these different options will link to different videos and pictures, to show the consequence of 
that action. Eventually, I would like to upload the video to a reliable online platform so that his students can watch it.

### Student - The person who watched the video.
- I am a student who is working on artificial feeding. After reading the textbook and watched several videos on YouTube, I am still extremely nervous about this. 
- But luckily, my teacher provided us a set of 360-videos and it helps me understanding the real situation and tells me what results I will have if I am slightly wrong in 
several steps. The 360-video makes me feel that I am working in the real environment and I can interact with the video by clicking the hotspots. Also I can navigate through
the videos by subtitles and hotspots, even there’s a translation of subtitles so that I can watch videos provided by clinicians from other countries.
