# Phase 5: Work with real cases

## Week January 29th 2021

### Meeting with clients
- We had our meeting with our clients and showed our first prototype to them.
- They are quite happy with that.
- We received a real-usecase video from our client Sheena.
- The video is protected under GDPR regulations so we cannot show it here.

### Group Work
- Since Unity files are really big and complicated, it is hard for us to coorperate using Github.
- So we researched about how to coorperate when working with unity.
- We finally found Unity Collaberation on Unity Cloud. 
- Although it is not perfect and always introducing bugs, that's the best thing that we could find.
